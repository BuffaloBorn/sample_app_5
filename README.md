### What we learned in this chapter

#### Mostly static pages

  *  For a third time, we went through the full procedure of creating a new Rails application from scratch, installing the necessary gems, pushing it up to a remote repository, and deploying it to production.
  *  The rails script generates a new controller with rails generate controller ControllerName <optional action names>.
  *  New routes are defined in the file config/routes.rb.
  *  Rails views can contain static HTML or embedded Ruby (ERb).
  *  Automated testing allows us to write test suites that drive the development of new features, allow for confident refactoring, and catch regressions.
  *  Test-driven development uses a “Red, Green, Refactor” cycle.
  *  Rails layouts allow the use of a common template for pages in our application, thereby eliminating duplication.

#### Rails Flavored Ruby

  * Ruby has a large number of methods for manipulating strings of characters.
  * Everything in Ruby is an object.
  * Ruby supports method definition via the def keyword.
  * Ruby supports class definition via the class keyword.
  * Rails views can contain static HTML or embedded Ruby (ERb).
  * Built-in Ruby data structures include arrays, ranges, and hashes.
  * Ruby blocks are a flexible construct that (among other things) allow natural iteration over enumerable data structures.
  * Symbols are labels, like strings without any additional structure.
  * Ruby supports object inheritance.
  * It is possible to open up and modify built-in Ruby classes.
  * The word “deified” is a palindrome.

#### Filling in the layout

  * Using HTML5, we can define a site layout with logo, header, footer, and main body content.
  * Rails partials are used to place markup in a separate file for convenience.
  * CSS allows us to style the site layout based on CSS classes and ids.
  * The Bootstrap framework makes it easy to make a nicely designed site quickly.
  * Sass and the asset pipeline allow us to eliminate duplication in our CSS while packaging up the results efficiently for production.
  * Rails allows us to define custom routing rules, thereby providing named routes.
  * Integration tests effectively simulate a browser clicking from page to page.

####  Modeling users

  * Migrations allow us to modify our application’s data model.
  * Active Record comes with a large number of methods for creating and manipulating data models.
  * Active Record validations allow us to place constraints on the data in our models.
  * Common validations include presence, length, and format.
  * Regular expressions are cryptic but powerful.
  * Defining a database index improves lookup efficiency while allowing enforcement of uniqueness at the database level.
  * We can add a secure password to a model using the built-in has_secure_password method.

####  Sign up

  * Rails displays useful debug information via the debug method.
  * Sass mixins allow a group of CSS rules to be bundled and reused in multiple places.
  * Rails comes with three standard environments: development, test, and production.
  * We can interact with users as a resource through a standard set of REST URLs.
  * Gravatars provide a convenient way of displaying images to represent users.
  * The form_for helper is used to generate forms for interacting with Active Record objects.
  * Signup failure renders the new user page and displays error messages automatically determined by Active Record.
  * Rails provides the flash as a standard way to display temporary messages.
  * Signup success creates a user in the database and redirects to the user show page, and displays a welcome message.
  * We can use integration tests to verify form submission behavior and catch regressions.
  * We can configure our production application to use SSL for secure communications and Puma for high performance.

####  Basic login

  * Rails can maintain state from one page to the next using temporary cookies via the session method.
  * The login form is designed to create a new session to log a user in.
  * The flash.now method is used for flash messages on rendered pages.
  * Test-driven development is useful when debugging by reproducing the bug in a test.
  * Using the session method, we can securely place a user id on the browser to create a temporary session.
  * We can change features such as links on the layouts based on login status.
  * Integration tests can verify correct routes, database updates, and proper changes to the layout.

#### Advance login

  * Rails can maintain state from one page to the next using persistent cookies via the cookies method.
  * We associate to each user a remember token and a corresponding remember digest for use in persistent sessions.
  * Using the cookies method, we create a persistent session by placing a permanent remember token cookie on the browser.
  * Login status is determined by the presence of a current user based on the temporary session’s user id or the permanent session’s unique remember token.
  * The application signs users out by deleting the session’s user id and removing the permanent cookie from the browser.
  * The ternary operator is a compact way to write simple if-then statements.


#### Updating, showing, and deleting users

  * Users can be updated using an edit form, which sends a PATCH request to the update action.
  * Safe updating through the web is enforced using strong parameters.
  * Before filters give a standard way to run methods before particular controller actions.
  * We implement an authorization using before filters.
  * Authorization tests use both low-level commands to submit particular HTTP requests directly to controller actions and high-level integration tests.
  * Friendly forwarding redirects users where they wanted to go after logging in.
  * The users index page shows all users, one page at a time.
  * Rails uses the standard file ```db/seeds.rb``` to seed the database with sample data using ```rails db:seed```.
  * Running ```render @users``` automatically calls the ```_user.html.erb``` partial on each user in the collection.  
  * A boolean attribute called admin on the User model automatically creates an admin? boolean method on user objects.
  * Admins can delete users through the web by clicking on delete links that issue DELETE requests to the Users controller ```destroy``` action.
  * We can create a large number of test users using embedded Ruby inside fixtures.

#### Account activation

  * Like sessions, account activations can be modeled as a resource despite not being Active Record objects.
  * Rails can generate Action Mailer actions and views to send email.
  * Action Mailer supports both plain-text and HTML mail.
  * As with ordinary actions and views, instance variables defined in mailer actions are available in mailer views.
  * Account activations use a generated token to create a unique URL for activating users.
  * Account activations use a hashed activation digest to securely identify valid activation requests.
  * Both mailer tests and integration tests are useful for verifying the behavior of the User mailer.
  * We can send email in production using SendGrid.

#### Password reset

  * Like sessions and account activations, password resets can be modeled as a resource despite not being Active Record objects.
  * Rails can generate Action Mailer actions and views to send email.
  * Action Mailer supports both plain-text and HTML mail.
  * As with ordinary actions and views, instance variables defined in mailer actions are available in mailer views.
  * Password resets use a generated token to create a unique URL for resetting passwords.
  * Password resets use a hashed reset digest to securely identify valid reset requests.
  * Both mailer tests and integration tests are useful for verifying the behavior of the User mailer.
  * We can send email in production using SendGrid.

#### User microposts

 * Microposts, like Users, are modeled as a resource backed by an Active Record model.
 * Rails supports multiple-key indices.
 * We can model a user having many microposts using the has_many and belongs_to methods in the User and Micropost models, respectively.
 * The has_many/belongs_to combination gives rise to methods that work through the association.
 * The code user.microposts.build(...) returns a new Micropost object automatically associated with the given user.
 * Rails supports default ordering via default_scope.
 * Scopes take anonymous functions as arguments.
 * The dependent: :destroy option causes objects to be destroyed at the same time as associated objects.
 * Pagination and object counts can both be performed through associations, leading to automatically efficient code.
 * Fixtures support the creation of associations.
 * It is possible to pass variables to Rails partials.
 * The where method can be used to perform Active Record selections.
 * We can enforce secure operations by always creating and destroying dependent objects through their association.
 * We can upload and resize images using CarrierWave.
