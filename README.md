## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial* book](http://www.railstutorial.org/book).

#### Useful rails console snippet

```bash
$ rails console
>> flash = { success: "It worked!", danger: "It failed." }
=> {:success=>"It worked!", danger: "It failed."}
>> flash.each do |key, value|
?>   puts "#{key}"
?>   puts "#{value}"
>> end
success
It worked!
danger
It failed.
>> User.find_by(email:"example@railstutorial.org")
=> #<User id: 1, name: "Rails Tutorial", email: "example@railstutorial.org", created_at: "2017-12-06 01:04:13", updated_at: "2017-12-06 01:04:13", password_digest: "$2a$10$WwydSt3xyWmAcXGGUB5KgO.hmhuCZs3nSJ7trS/zcgy...">

#### Useful rails task

```bash
$ rails db:migrate:reset
```
#### Some useful assert_select options.

### What we learned in this chapter

#### Mostly static pages

  *  For a third time, we went through the full procedure of creating a new Rails application from scratch, installing the necessary gems, pushing it up to a remote repository, and deploying it to production.
  *  The rails script generates a new controller with rails generate controller ControllerName <optional action names>.
  *  New routes are defined in the file config/routes.rb.
  *  Rails views can contain static HTML or embedded Ruby (ERb).
  *  Automated testing allows us to write test suites that drive the development of new features, allow for confident refactoring, and catch regressions.
  *  Test-driven development uses a “Red, Green, Refactor” cycle.
  *  Rails layouts allow the use of a common template for pages in our application, thereby eliminating duplication.

#### Rails Flavored Ruby

  * Ruby has a large number of methods for manipulating strings of characters.
  * Everything in Ruby is an object.
  * Ruby supports method definition via the def keyword.
  * Ruby supports class definition via the class keyword.
  * Rails views can contain static HTML or embedded Ruby (ERb).
  * Built-in Ruby data structures include arrays, ranges, and hashes.
  * Ruby blocks are a flexible construct that (among other things) allow natural iteration over enumerable data structures.
  * Symbols are labels, like strings without any additional structure.
  * Ruby supports object inheritance.
  * It is possible to open up and modify built-in Ruby classes.
  * The word “deified” is a palindrome.

#### Filling in the layout

  * Using HTML5, we can define a site layout with logo, header, footer, and main body content.
  * Rails partials are used to place markup in a separate file for convenience.
  * CSS allows us to style the site layout based on CSS classes and ids.
  * The Bootstrap framework makes it easy to make a nicely designed site quickly.
  * Sass and the asset pipeline allow us to eliminate duplication in our CSS while packaging up the results efficiently for production.
  * Rails allows us to define custom routing rules, thereby providing named routes.
  * Integration tests effectively simulate a browser clicking from page to page.

####  Modeling users

  * Migrations allow us to modify our application’s data model.
  * Active Record comes with a large number of methods for creating and manipulating data models.
  * Active Record validations allow us to place constraints on the data in our models.
  * Common validations include presence, length, and format.
  * Regular expressions are cryptic but powerful.
  * Defining a database index improves lookup efficiency while allowing enforcement of uniqueness at the database level.
  * We can add a secure password to a model using the built-in has_secure_password method.

####  Sign up

  * Rails displays useful debug information via the debug method.
  * Sass mixins allow a group of CSS rules to be bundled and reused in multiple places.
  * Rails comes with three standard environments: development, test, and production.
  * We can interact with users as a resource through a standard set of REST URLs.
  * Gravatars provide a convenient way of displaying images to represent users.
  * The form_for helper is used to generate forms for interacting with Active Record objects.
  * Signup failure renders the new user page and displays error messages automatically determined by Active Record.
  * Rails provides the flash as a standard way to display temporary messages.
  * Signup success creates a user in the database and redirects to the user show page, and displays a welcome message.
  * We can use integration tests to verify form submission behavior and catch regressions.
  * We can configure our production application to use SSL for secure communications and Puma for high performance.

####  Basic login

  * Rails can maintain state from one page to the next using temporary cookies via the session method.
  * The login form is designed to create a new session to log a user in.
  * The flash.now method is used for flash messages on rendered pages.
  * Test-driven development is useful when debugging by reproducing the bug in a test.
  * Using the session method, we can securely place a user id on the browser to create a temporary session.
  * We can change features such as links on the layouts based on login status.
  * Integration tests can verify correct routes, database updates, and proper changes to the layout.
